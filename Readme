## Installation and Setup

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   Access the API at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

### Frontend (React.js)
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Access the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Running Both Components Simultaneously
1. Open two terminal windows or tabs.
2. In the first terminal, start the backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
3. In the second terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

---

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment
Use a production-grade ASGI server for deploying the backend:
```bash
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app
```

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the frontend for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Serve the contents of the `build` folder using a static file server or integrate it with the backend.
